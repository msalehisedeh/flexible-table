# Welcome to Flexible table!

Have you ever looked for a simple way of flushing your data in a versatile table by passing in a few meta-data instructions just to get your data displayed the way you wanted with interactive components inside? AND how about adding graphics into the resulting table with some nifty formatting rules just by mapping your JSON data into table column headers! Ha? Say it again!! And all is done without writing much of any code!! On top of that, if you do not want to take time and write meta-data rules, FlexibleTable will generate the rules for you. You can feed any data to the table and see it tabulated!!

FlexibleTable and LockTable are Angular based code. LockTable will allow you to lock/unlock columns. Both tables are fully configurable with pagination and ability to re-order table columns through drag/drop operation.

**NOTE:** Starting from Angular 15, you can edit/validate a change content on a specific row/column

**NOTE:** If your project still is angular 2, 4, or 5; please luck-down your version reference to flexible table to 1.7.1 version by removing ^ from the version dependency in your package json. Otherwise for Angular 6+, please use 1.7.2 version or higher.

**NOTE:** Starting with version 1.8.2 you need to import this library through @sedeh/flexible-table.
